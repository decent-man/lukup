A quick webscraper tool to lookup info from your favourite websites.

For now it can only do pure text. No image,javascript,video,etc. :(

It uses JSON files as configurations so it can already scrape from websites given the correct json.

The program is very basic at the moment. So the resulting output may look messed up for certain websites.
