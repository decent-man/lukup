# lukup
A quick webscraper tool to lookup info from your favourite websites.

For now it can only do pure text. No image,javascript,video,etc. :(

<!--It uses JSON files as configurations so it can already scrape from websites given the correct json.-->

The program is very basic at the moment. So the resulting output may look messed up for certain websites.

## Usage

1. Select the search text you want to lookup.
2. Copy it to clipboard first.
3. Invoke lukup.
4. Lukup will show a list of websites it has profiles for.
   If the website you are looking for doesn't exist, choose **+ Add Website**.
  - Search for `ASPERO0 GETARO1` on your website and paste the link of the resulting page that opens up.
  - Lukup will process the link and ask you for a proper search term appropriate according to the website.
  - Lukup will open the page in **Element Selection Mode**. Select the web element which has the information you look for.
  - The selected element's profile will be created.
5. Select the website in which you want to lookup information for.
6. Be Enlightened.
